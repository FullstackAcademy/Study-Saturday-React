# Study-Saturday-Week3

## Objective: Build a React front-end for our CRUD app

### Details
	- Front end should consist of a table view of all students
	- Clicking on a student should show a detailed view of that individual student's test scores


### Getting Started
1) fork and `git clone`

2) `npm install`

3) `npm run seed`

4) `git checkout cycle-1`



#### Tips
- Take a look at .babelrc and webpack.config.js, this will give you clues as to how to structure your app.
- All your React code should feed into browser/index.js
- Use axios to access your express routes Via AJAX. This is just like fetch, but more compatible with React!

#### Note for Instructors
- It may be best to do a guided mob code of the necessary webpack/.babelrc infrastructure before letting students loose on the React code!
- Emphasize that students will usually be working with a boilerplate, and it's not super important to learn the nitty-gritty of .babelrc and wepback at this moment. They should be getting more comfortable looking up unknowns in the documentation.
